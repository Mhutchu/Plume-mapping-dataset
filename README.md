# Plume-mapping-dataset

Data collected using a PID detector onboard a Turtlebot robot in response to an acetone vapour source.

Data are availlable for multiple experiments using different gas sampling times (how long the robot paused to take an average measurement from the PID detector).

Data are availlable for a total of 54 experiments.

The first two columns of each file are location coordinates where the measurements were made. The remaining columns represent measurements taken at the corresponding locations during separate experiments.
